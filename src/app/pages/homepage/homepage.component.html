      <p>
        Our goal is simplicity and efficiency. That's why our service is written
        in Rust. Our primary endpoint is right on the root of our endpoint. Just
        make a <code>POST</code> and we'll take care of the rest. You can call
        our API from anywhere, on any device, and in any programming language.
        Below is an example of how you can use fwdr directly in the browser.

  method: 'POST',
  body: &#123;
    to: 'example&#64;fwdr.dev',
    subject: "fwdr demo",
    body: "Hey, Welcome to fwdr",
  &#125;

        <p>
          We are still in our beta phase. We are doing some analysis on how we
          can make our service better. Therefore, at any moment anything can
          change; including the API itself. So, please keep that in mind until
          we work towards our stable release of fwdr.
        </p>
        <p>
          As mentioned above, our core values at fwdr are simplicity and
          efficiency for everyone. What good is an e-mail forwarding service if
          it's too cumbersome to use? We plan on having fwdr become feature-rich
          &mdash; without compromising our core values.
        </p>
        <p>Stay tuned to witness fwdr blossom.</p>
        <p>&mdash; Marcello, Core Developer</p>
